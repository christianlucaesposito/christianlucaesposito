## Hello 👋 I am Christian Luca Esposito (He/Him)

I am Christian, a first generation bachelor graduate in psychology, and a student in computer science at UBC ✨
I got introduced to coding at my job as a researcher at UBC! I found programming to be quite fun, and now I am devoting my time to learn more!

Welcome to my github! There is not too much going on now, but I hope to make this page much more exciting with time 🌼🌸
